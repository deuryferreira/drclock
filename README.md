### Digital Clock and Temporizer made with vanilla Javascript!

Useful to learn some concepts as manipulating DOM and using HTML, CSS and Javascript
Actually i made this simple app thinking about a solution for time management at church scenario or any other performance.

Has some interesting options like

1. Background color change
2. Temporizer with color background alert when bwlow five minutes
3. Configurable Temporizer time
4. Reset counter option

I will update the app using some JS framework and modern libraries in the future...
